## Errata

Everything works right now. I had the hardest times writing handle browse request 
and all of the functions in request but once I got those the rest flowed easily. 
I currently think the handle_browse_request() function looks messy right now because 
of all of the checks I must perform in there for the thumbnails guru point. Sorry 
for the long video I tried to cut it down. 


## Contributions

I did everything because I worked by myself. I completed the thumbnails guru point and the vps guru point as shown..
